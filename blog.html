                <p class="title">Does it matter to use relative size on styling the size of an element?</p>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        As browser features matured, the way we code our sites evolved into a whole new paradigm .
                        We switched from defining and coding our units of measurements in <strong>Pixels</strong>
                        and began using relative Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) units more consistently in our CSS to meet the needs of ever changing
                        viewport sizes. On point of that, browsers have added more features to allow us to create flexible
                        and robust designs. For instance, <strong>browser zooming.</strong>The most important reason 
                        for using responsive and unitless values in CSS is for supporting users that relay on zooming.
                        At this point , a debate can arise between browser zooming ability and CSS relative units.
                        Some of the debaters say, browsers handle all the font zooming for us, so we don't have to convert
                        our typography to relative units in css. Users don't bother to adjust the font display settings in
                        the browser.On the other hand opponents say, yes, browsers handle page zoom for us, yet there's a 
                        difference between how the UI appears when the page is zoomed, depending on whether the default browser
                        size has been adjusted as well. Users do bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser so
                        we need to account for that in our CSS declarations. But, I am against the debaters who said that 
                        CSS relative units should not be applied to style a page. Take a look for example, vision disabilities,
                        if we don't apply relative units in our css and if the vision disabilities want to zoom in to have a clear 
                        vision by going to the browser setting and increasing font size, nothing will be increased unless the css is 
                        in relative units. Even though it is possible to use browser zooming feature to zoom, you can only zoom 
                        to specific number choices like 100%,110%,120%...etc,depending on browsers. But using relative units 
                        you can give different zoom features depending on the parent root.

                <p class="title">16px is default browser font-size so what does it mean when we say 200px?How 
                    does the browser interpret that?
                </p>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Setting the font size in pixel values (px) is a good choice when you need pixel accuracy which is static.
                        Needless to say, the default browser  font-size is 16px. For the browser 16px is equal to 100% and
                        everything is scaled compared to 16px. For example, if the font size of a paragraph
                        is 200px, the browser will calculate it like: if 16px is 100%, 200px is what?
                        So it will understand it as 200px is 1250 times default browser size(16px).
                        like 32px is twice of the default value. But, the browser passes a lot of steps to understand
                        this. Let's look at it.
                        When you write some HTML, CSS, and JS, and attempt to open the HTML file in your browser, 
                        the browser reads the <strong>raw bytes</strong> of HTML from your hard disk (or network).But not the 
                        actual characters you have written.
                        The browser receives the bytes of data, but it can’t really do anything with it; the raw bytes of 
                        data must be converted to a form it understands. So, the raw bytes will be converted into <strong>characters</strong>
                        and these characters are further parsed into something called <strong>tokens</strong>. Thus, the HTML file will be
                        broken down to tokens and this is how the browser begins to understand what we have written. Then,
                        the tokens will be converted into <strong>nodes</strong>. Upon creating these nodes, the nodes are then linked in a 
                        tree data structure known as the <strong>Document Object Model(DOM)</strong>. But, we didn't still come to CSS and measurements.
                        But, While the browser receives the raw bytes of data and kicks off the DOM construction process, it will also 
                        make a request to fetch the .css stylesheet linked.As soon the browser begins to parse the HTML, upon finding a 
                        link tag to a CSS file, it simultaneously makes a request to fetch that. Here after, the same procedure 
                        like the HTML will be applied. Raw bytes-characters-tokens-nodes-tree formed and the bytes-characters-tokens-nodes-tree
                        created is called <strong>CSSOM(CSS Object Model)</strong>. Now,the browser combines the DOM and CSSOM trees into something 
                        called a render tree. With the render tree constructed, the next step is to perform the layout. Right now, 
                        we have the content and style information of all visible content on the screen, but we haven’t actually 
                        rendered anything to the screen. Here it comes the calculation that we have talked earlier. The browser
                        has to calculate the exact size and position of each object on the page. Then, the browser will begin to 
                        calculate relative to the default browser size.With the information about the exact positions of each element now computed, 
                        all that is left is to paint the elements to the screen.
