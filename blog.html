                <article>
                    <p>
                        As browser features matured, the way we code our sites evolved into a whole new paradigm .
                        We switched from defining and coding our units of measurements in <strong>Pixels</strong>
                        and began using relative Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) units more consistently in our CSS to meet the needs of ever changing
                        viewport sizes. On point of that, browsers have added more features to allow us to create flexible
                        and robust designs. For instance, <strong>browser zooming.</strong>The most important reason 
                        for using responsive and unitless values in CSS is for supporting users that relay on zooming.
                        At this point , a debate can arise between browser zooming ability and CSS relative units.
                        Some of the debaters say, browsers handle all the font zooming for us, so we don't have to convert
                        our typography to relative units in css. Users don't bother to adjust the font display settings in
                        the browser.On the other hand opponents say, yes, browsers handle page zoom for us, yet there's a 
                        difference between how the UI appears when the page is zoomed, depending on whether the default browser
                        size has been adjusted as well. Users do bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser so
                        we need to account for that in our CSS declarations. But, I am against the debaters who said that 
                        CSS relative units should not be applied to style a page. Take a look for example, vision disabilities,
                        if we don't apply relative units in our css and if the vision disabilities want to zoom in to have a clear 
                        vision by going to the browser setting and increasing font size, nothing will be increased unless the css is 
                        in relative units. Even though it is possible to use browser zooming feature to zoom, you can only zoom 
                        to specific number choices like 100%,110%,120%...etc,depending on browsers. But using relative units 
                        you can give different zoom features depending on the parent root.
